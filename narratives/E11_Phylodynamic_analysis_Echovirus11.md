abstract: "
Thank you for having a look at the supplementary results of the phylodynamic analysis. This Nextstrain *narrative* covers the same results, but allows the visualisation of a bit more nuances. Moreover, Auspice allows any viewer to explore the data. In case of any questions, feel free to contact me at _stends2001@gmail.com_. I will be covering the following topics in general, but I have uploaded the data with a few more variables that allows you to explore the analysis.

# [Echovirus 11 Genotypes](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/PG/pVP1?branchLabel=Genotype_VP1&showBranchLabels=all)
This tree shows the division of sequences into genotypes based on the VP1 sequences.

# [Echovirus 11 Sub-genotypes](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/PG/pVP1?branchLabel=Genotype_VP1&c=Subgenotype_VP1&showBranchLabels=all)
This tree shows the division of sequences into sub-genotypes based on the VP1 sequences.

# [Echovirus 11 Lineages](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/PG/pVP1?branchLabel=Genotype_VP1&c=Subsubgenotype_VP1&showBranchLabels=all)
This tree shows the division of sequences into lineages based on the VP1 sequences.

# [Echvovirus 11 Lineage: D5.12](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/PG/pVP1?c=Country)
Within lineage D5.12, a newly emerging clade can be observed, with 24 out of the 30 sequences representing _study sequences_, all of which isolated in Europe.

# [Echovirus 11 RFs](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/CG/3DPol)
This tree shows the division of complete genome-sequences into recombinant forms (RFs).

# [Echovirus 11 Lineages - complete genomes](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/CG/VP1)
This tree shows the division of complete genome-sequences into lineages.

# [Echovirus 11 Tanglegram VP1-3DPol](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/CG/VP1:community/stends2001/E11/CG/3DPol?c=Tanglegram_genotype)
This is the tanglegram showing the association between VP1 lineages and (3DPol) RFs.

# [Echovirus 11 Tanglegram Lineage: D5.8](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/CG/VP1:community/stends2001/E11/CG/3DPol?c=Tanglegram_genotype&label=Tanglegram_genotype:VP1_D5.8)
D5.8 is a clear example of a lineage that is associated with two distinct RFs. Half of the sequences link to RF H, and half to RF M.

# [Echovirus 11 Tanglegram Lineage: D5.12](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/CG/VP1:community/stends2001/E11/CG/3DPol?c=Tanglegram_genotype&label=Tanglegram_genotype:VP1_D5.12)
D5.12 is clearly associated with a sequence RF, namely L.

# [EV-B Species - VP1](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/EV-B/VP1)
This slide provides a quick overview of the phylogenetic relations between E11 and other members of the EV-B species, based on the VP1-gene. As enteroviruses are typed on the VP1-region, it follows that based on this region, clades form according to the types. The clade on top represents the one formed by E11

# [EV-B Species - 3DPol](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/EV-B/3DPol)
When it comes to the 3DPol-gene, however, this is far from the case. Instead, clades seem very chaotic, suggesting that RFs are shared among multiple EV-types.

# [EV-B Species - VP1 and 3DPol](https://nextstrain.org/community/stends2001/E11/EV-B/VP1:community/stends2001/E11/EV-B/3DPol)
We see some clear recombination in the tanglegram, where closely related sequences in the VP1-region are associated with different RFs. This publicly available dataset could provide the start for future in-depth analyses on recombination patterns within, and between, multiple EV types.
